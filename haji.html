        <p>
            The Haji Ali Dargah is a stunning white mosque and tomb located on a small islet off the coast of Mumbai. Built in 1431, it is one of the most recognizable landmarks of the city. The Indo-Islamic architecture, combined with its location in the Arabian Sea, makes it a unique pilgrimage site for both Muslims and non-Muslims.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            The shrine is dedicated to Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, a wealthy merchant from Bukhara (now Uzbekistan) who later renounced his material wealth to become a Sufi saint. According to legend, before his death, he requested that his body be set adrift in the ocean. Miraculously, his casket washed up on the rocky islet where the dargah stands today.
        </p>
        <p>
            The structure is accessible only during low tide via a narrow causeway that extends into the sea. Visitors flock to the dargah for blessings, peace, and to witness its breathtaking location, especially during sunsets.
